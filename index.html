      So, alpine doesn't work nicely with multi-level composing. To be fair, vue doesn't work very well there either,
      what with props needing to be passed all over and vue having special functionality specifically for passing properties
      down deep, and the way reactivity works and all that. It's a fundamentally flawed system, and maybe we can sidestep it?

      So I can compose templates using my old fashioned method of creating id'd elements inside a big template node, 
      then pre-composing (copying) all the fillers (which would be custom tags in other frameworks). This way, I only have
      to write the components once, but then they're just copied all over for use in alpine, so a "big" piece will be
      pre-composed to be... well, big.

      With the big templates, I can then write the alpine data functionality for each piece that I plan to use 
      individually. So, I don't need one for message_fragment just yet because I never plan to use message_fragment
      by itself. I MIGHT use message_block, but not yet, so it doesn't need it.

      But, there could be a message list which simply represents an ordered list of message blocks. That one will
      have the data... or hm. Should I instead compose things top-down? Think in terms of big widgets you can immediately use
      for things?

      For instance, yes you could make a message list, but isn't it more immediately useful to have a message scroller which
      can also manage its own set of messages, loading older etc? Also, when will you ever want a message scroller without SOME 
      way to get at the page data itself, so maybe wrap the WHOLE thing up? Page display, scroller, etc. And then if you
      need to pull the individual parts out... hm.

      So the fake scroller may be a useful element by itself, that's the problem. And it's something I could design with
      alpine... well maybe it could just be a set of common functions, if I need it somewhere else. Fake scrolling is
      only useful for realtime data anyway, and that's specifically chat. The rest can be real scrollers.

      So my first task is to create basically the whole thing that goes inside a chat tab. Some kind of header that
      can expand to show the page data, and the scroller underneath. it'll be a BIG component with a single x-data. 
      Loading it will what... just send the id of the page? Sometimes you already HAVE the data though... or do you?
      You don't ever get the full page data on new message from the live system, so... SHOULD this system be entirely
      self contained? Less efficient, more easy? Other people are making optimized frontends, maybe I should
      make the easy frontend...
